# Capstone2TheGame
A program to make a very simple game using the pygame library.
One of the best ways of learning to program is by writing games.
Pygame is a collection of modules in one package.
You will need to install pygame.
 To do so:
 1) open the command line interface on your computer,
 2) cd to the directory that this task is located in,
 3) follow the instructions here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
 4) if you need help using pip, see here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/using-pip-on-windows

import pygame # Imports a game library that lets you use specific functions in your program.
import random # Import to generate random numbers. 

 Initialize the pygame modules to get everything started.
